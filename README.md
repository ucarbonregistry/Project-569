The project activity is a bundled wind energy initiative with a total capacity of 23.2 MW, operated
by Ghodawat Energy Pvt Ltd, Ghodawat Realty Pvt Ltd, Star Flexipacks Industries Ltd, and Sanjay
D. Ghodawat, as outlined in the table. Ghodawat Energy Pvt Ltd has an installed capacity of 9.2
MW across sites in Gujarat (Jodhpar, Moti Vavdi, Satapar-2) and Rajasthan (Temdarai). Ghodawat
Realty Pvt Ltd operates 11.6 MW at locations in Gujarat (Maleta, Jamvadi, Hadmatiya) and
Rajasthan (Gorera). Star Flexipacks Industries Ltd contributes 0.8 MW at Jodhpar, Gujarat, while
Sanjay D. Ghodawat contributes 1.6 MW at Maleta, Gujarat.

In the absence of the project activity, electricity would have been delivered to the grid by the
operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuelbased generation sources in the grid. As it’s a nature of wind projects (renewable energy), no fossil
fuel is involved for power generation in the project activity. The electricity produced by the project
is directly contributing to climate change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs, i.e. CO2) into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent amount of
power at grid.
